# Flight Delay Prediction with Deep RNN and LSTM architecture

This project is implemented as a part of the Course CSE 571 Artificial Intelligence. 

Flight Delay is predicted using Deep Learning approach. Day-to-day sequences of the departure and arrival flight delays of an individual airport have been modeled by the Long Short-Term Memory RNN architecture. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed prediction model was measured, analyzed
